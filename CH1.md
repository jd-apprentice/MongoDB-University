# Chapter 1 - What is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of development and scaling.

### Why is MongoDB a NoSQL database?

- Because it uses a structured way to store and access data
- Because it does not utilize tables, rows and columns to organize data

The following 10 easy steps will guide you in creating:

- an Atlas Organization named MDBU
- a Project within MDBU called M001
- a Free Tier Atlas cluster named Sandbox

- 1. Select Create an Organization

- 6. Select Create Project

- 7. Select Build a Database

- 9. Select the region that is geographically closest to your location. On the bottom of the page change the cluster name to Sandbox. Create the cluster. This step might take a minute or two to complete.

```Now that you have an Atlas cluster you need to grant access to your IP Address and create a Database User.

You should see Security Quickstart now.

With Username and Password selected, create a user for your database with the following username and password

- username: <YourUser>
- password: <YourPassword>
- Click on Create User
```

- Select the option on the left My Local Environment and add an entry under Add entries to your IP Access List. Add your local IP address 0.0.0.0/0 and click Add Entry

- Allowing access from anywhere is *not a good security practice. Production clusters should not have this enabled and should limit network access.
- Finally, click Finish and Close at the bottom.

#### Load the Sample Dataset

- Select the "â€¦" option in the cluster menu -> choose the "Load Sample Dataset" option, then confirm your choice.

- When the dataset is loaded the graph labeled "Logical Size" on the right side of the screen should go up and display the size of the dataset that is above zero and below 512 MB. Your graph may look different than the picture below.
